### 2. Payment Processing
- MercadoPago gateway integration
- Secure card tokenization
- Payment retry logic
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

### 3. Business Logic
- Usage-based billing (extra orders)
- Prorated plan changes
- 15-day cooldown between plan changes
- Maximum 3 retry attempts for failed payments

### 4. Notifications
- Discord webhook integration
- Success notifications
- Failure alerts
- Plan change confirmations

## Architecture Highlights

### Clean Architecture Layers

Domain (Business Rules)
  - Entities: Subscription, Plan, Invoice
  - Value Objects: Money, Document, BillingCycle
  - Services: ProrationCalculator, PlanChangeEvaluator
  
Application (Use Cases)
  - CreateSubscription
  - RenewSubscription
  - ChangeSubscriptionPlan
  - ChangeCreditCard
  - CancelSubscription
  
Infrastructure (Technical Details)
  - MercadoPago Gateway
  - Eloquent Repositories
  - Discord Notifications
  
Presentation (API/Controllers)
  - HTTP Controllers
  - Request Validation

### Design Patterns Used

1. Repository Pattern
   Data persistence abstraction

2. Strategy Pattern
   Interchangeable payment gateways

3. Factory Pattern
   Entity creation

4. Value Object Pattern
   Immutable validated objects

5. Adapter Pattern
   External API integration

## Code Quality Metrics

- Zero framework dependencies in Domain layer
- 100% type-safe with strict types
- Immutable value objects
- Comprehensive unit tests
- PSR-12 coding standards
- PHPStan level 9 ready

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Value Objects: Money, Document, Email
- Entities: Subscription, Plan, Invoice
- Services: ProrationCalculator

### Integration Tests
- Payment Gateway integration
- Repository implementations
- Notification services

### Use Case Tests
- Mocked dependencies
- Business flow validation
- Error handling

## How to Run

Install dependencies:
composer install

Run tests:
composer test

Run static analysis:
composer analyse

Format code:
composer format

## Why This Architecture?

### Benefits

1. Testability
   - Domain logic tested without database
   - Mock external services easily
   - Fast test execution

2. Maintainability
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Easy to locate bugs
   - Simple to add features

3. Flexibility
   - Swap payment gateways without changing domain
   - Change database without touching business logic
   - Add new notification channels effortlessly

4. Scalability
   - Domain layer is performance-optimized
   - Can extract to microservices
   - Horizontal scaling ready

## Real-World Production Considerations

This showcase includes:
- Error handling and logging
- Retry logic for failed payments
- Proration calculations
- Usage-based billing
- Idempotency for payment requests
- Webhook notifications
- Audit trail (invoices)

Not included (would be in production):
- Database migrations
- API authentication
- Rate limiting
- Webhook signature verification
- Email notifications
- Admin dashboard
- Monitoring/metrics

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Monolithic Service - 1112 lines)

class AdminSubscriptionService
{
    // 1112 lines
    // Mixed responsibilities
    // Hard to test
    // Tightly coupled to Laravel
    // No separation of concerns
}

### After (Clean Architecture)

// Domain Layer (Business Logic)
$subscription->recordSuccessfulPayment($id, $date);

// Application Layer (Use Case)
$useCase->execute($dto);

// Infrastructure Layer (Technical)
$gateway->processPayment($data);

Key improvements:
- 60+ focused classes replacing 1 monolith
- Each class < 250 lines
- Single responsibility
- Fully testable
- Framework-independent core

## Learning Value

This project demonstrates:
- How to refactor legacy code to Clean Architecture
- Proper use of DDD tactical patterns
- TDD-friendly design
- Professional PHP development practices
- Production-ready error handling

## Technical Highlights

### Immutable Value Objects
Money, Document, Email, and BillingCycle are immutable, ensuring data consistency and preventing unexpected mutations.

### Rich Domain Models
Entities contain business logic, not just data. Subscription entity handles payment recording, plan changes, and cancellations.

### Dependency Inversion
High-level modules (Use Cases) depend on abstractions (Repository Interfaces), not concrete implementations.

### Single Responsibility
Each class has one reason to change. ProrationCalculator only calculates proration, nothing else.

### Open/Closed Principle
Easy to add new payment gateways by implementing PaymentGatewayInterface without modifying existing code.

## Example: Creating a Subscription

$dto = new CreateSubscriptionDTO(
    userId: 123,
    planId: '1',
    cardToken: 'tok_abc',
    cardNumber: '4111111111111111',
    cardholderName: 'John Doe',
    cpfCnpj: '62887357018',
    expiryMonth: 12,
    expiryYear: 2025,
    cvv: '123'
);

$result = $createSubscriptionUseCase->execute($dto);

if ($result->success) {
    echo "Subscription created: {$result->subscriptionId}";
} else {
    echo "Error: {$result->errorMessage}";
}

## Files Count

- Domain Layer: 28 files
- Application Layer: 18 files
- Infrastructure Layer: 16 files
- Tests: 6+ test files
- Documentation: 3 markdown files

Total: 70+ well-organized files

## Next Steps (If Expanding)

- Add Stripe payment gateway
- Implement webhook handler
- Create admin API endpoints
- Add database migrations
- Build Vue.js frontend with Inertia
- Add event sourcing
- Implement CQRS pattern
- Add observability (logs, metrics, traces)

## Conclusion

This project showcases a real-world, production-ready implementation of Clean Architecture in PHP. It demonstrates not just theoretical knowledge, but practical application of advanced software engineering principles.

The code is maintainable, testable, flexible, and scalable - ready for enterprise use.
